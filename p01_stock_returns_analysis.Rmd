title: "Stock Return Analysis"

---

In this project, we focused on using Python and Pandas to retrieve historical stock prices from Yahoo finance to: 

1. Perform primary analysis of stock returns
2. Calculate key financial statistics or moments

All of the graphs and code can be found in the MBAN [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Master-of-Business-Analytics/Project_01_Financial_Analysis), feel free to download it and modify the numbers for your use case.
The Jupyter notebook can be opened in the executable environment Syzygy.

To start, we load all relevant packages into the python workspace


```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
import datetime
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
from pandas.util.testing import assert_frame_equal

yf.pdr_override()
pd.core.common.is_list_like = pd.api.types.is_list_like 
#The following line seems to be necessary due to a newer version of pandas
```

## Business Problem 
Stock markets play an important role in spurring economic growth and development through diversification opportunities. Investors can look at several different measures to gauge stock performance. In this project we would examine stocks from 4 technology corporations. The table below shows the companies and their corresponding tickers in Yahoo finance website.

 YAHOO_TICKER  | Company Name
:------------- |------------- 
 GOOG	       | Google
 AAPL	       | Apple
 AMZN	       | Amazon
 MSFT	       | Microsoft.


```python
tickers = ['MSFT','AAPL','GOOG','AMZN']
```

The stock adjusted prices are then retrieved from yahoo finance for the time frame 31 Dec 2018 - 31 Dec 2019.


```python
#set start and end date of the analysis
start = datetime.datetime(2018, 12, 31)
end = datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1)
```
Extract data from yahoo finance

```python
#Retrieve data from yahoo finance
f2AAPL = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start, end)

#Intiate the dictionnary that will store all the downloaded tick data
d = pd.DataFrame()
#Loop over each tickers to load the data to be stored in the dictionnary d
for tick in tickers:
    print('Downloading '+tick)
    try:
        f = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tick,start,end,threads=False,progress=False)
        d[tick] = f['Adj Close']  # select the adjusted close price
    except ValueError:
        print(' No data found')
        
```

## Stock Price Timeline 
The graph below is useful when comparing price trends. Microsoft and Apple have experienced relatively constant trends over the past year, however Google and Amazon have some variation in stock price over the one-year period observed.
```python
#plot the stock price evolution

#set size of plot
plt.figure(figsize=(25,8))

for i, col in enumerate(d.columns):
    d[col].plot()

plt.title('Price Evolution Comparison')
plt.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))
plt.show()
```

## Stock Return 
A stock return is the change in price on an asset or stock ,which may be represented in terms of price change or percentage change. In order to compare the stocks on a level playing field , the returns of the stocks is calculated. The daily returns is defined as the amount of percentage change in the value of a stock over a single day of trading.


```python
# Create table with daily returns
ret = d.pct_change()

print(ret.head())

#create table with monthly returns

```

                    MSFT      AAPL      GOOG      AMZN
    Date

<b> Monthly and Quarterly return calculation </b>
The monthly and quarterly returns can be calculated to get a more consolidated view of the stock returns.


```python
# Resample `aapl` to business months, take last observation as value 
monthly = d.resample('BM').apply(lambda x: x[-1])

# Calculate the monthly percentage change
month_ret = monthly.pct_change()
print(month_ret)

### Stock Return Analysis
In this project , we will focus on daily returns. We can visualize the data in order to obtain interesting insights about the data. 


```python
# Line plot of the returns
ret.plot()
plt.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))
plt.show()
```


![](images/p01_02.png)


The line plot does not tell us much about the difference in variation across the stocks. The return distributions below enables us to quickly determine the differences in stock behavior over the last year.


```python
# Plot the distributions
ret.hist(bins=50, sharex=True, figsize=(12,8))
# Show the resulting plot
plt.show()
```


![](images/p01_03.png)


The volatility of a stock is a measurement of the change in variance in the returns of a stock over a specific period of time. It is common to compare the volatility of a stock with another stock to get a feel for which may have less risk or to a market index to examine the stock’s volatility in the overall market. Generally, the higher the volatility, the riskier the investment in that stock, which results in investing in one over another stock.

The distribution looks very symmetrical and normally distributed: the daily changes center around the bin 0.00. The returns of most of the stocks above, are between -0.05 and 0.05 ,however most Google shows a right skewed distribution and most of bars extend farther to the right when compared to the other stocks. Based on this distribution plots,  Google has performed better than Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, most of the time.

Another interesting plot is finding the relationship between the stocks, this analysis is useful in stocks in the same industry. The returns of a stock may be dependent on another stock. The plot below shows the scatter plots for each pair of stocks.



```python
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix

# Plot a scatter matrix with the `daily_pct_change` data 
scatter_matrix(ret, diagonal='kde', alpha=0.8,figsize=(12,12))

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

A scatter plot is a visual representation of the correlation between two items. It ties in with the correlation coefficient as it is used for indicating whether a linear relationship exists or not between two variables. The plot above shows that there is a positive relationship between each pair of stock return. To check if any of the stocks we are analyzing are correlated, a correlation matrix is created.

```python
mask = np.tril(ret.corr())
sns.heatmap(ret.corr(), vmin=-1,cmap=sns.diverging_palette(20, 220, n=200), vmax=1, center= 0,mask=mask)
plt.show()
```

Based on the correlation matrix, the returns of all the stocks are correlated with Amazon and Microsoft having the most correlation.

## Stock Evaluation 
When making a decision on what stock to invest in, there are five important statistics that are considered. These statistics are also called five moments of stock returns.

* Mean
* Standard deviation
* Skewness
* kurtosis
* Autocorrelation

### Mean and standard deviation
The standard deviation tells you how much the portfolio's return can deviate from the mean historical return. All of stocks have standard deviation that are greater than the mean, meaning that there is a higher risk, however this could be in an investor’s favor as there is a possibility of above average returns.


```python
#calculate mean
ret_mean=ret.mean()

#variance
ret_var=ret.var()

# calculate standard deviation
ret_std = ret.std()
ret_std2 = pd.DataFrame(ret.std())

#create dataframe of mean
out1 = pd.DataFrame(ret_mean)
out2 = out1.rename(columns={0: 'mean'})

#Add std as new column 
out3 = out2.join(ret_std2)
out4 = out3.rename(columns={0: 'std'})

print(out4.head())
```

              mean       std
    MSFT  0.001883  0.012491
    AAPL  0.002665  0.016466
    GOOG  0.001129  0.015208
    AMZN  0.000926  0.014432


### Skewness and Kurtosis
<b> Skewness</b> is used as an risk measurement tool when the data is exhibits asymmetrical distribution. Skewness can either be negative or positive. A stock with negative skewness is one that generates frequent small gains and few extreme or significant losses in the time period considered. On the other hand, a stock with positive skewness is one that generates frequent small losses and few extreme gains. 

<b>Kurtosis</b> serves to measure risk, as the abnormal returns on some instances could go beyond 3-times the standard deviation limit, according to the theory of normal distribution. Ignoring such extreme observations can create risks that are not captured by financial models based on normal distribution. When data follows normal distribution, the kurtosis has a value of three. Value greater than three means higher instances of abnormal returns, whereas low value of kurtosis (less than three).


```python
# calculate skewness
ret_skew=ret.skew()
# calculate Kurtosis
ret_kurt=ret.kurt()

#add as new column
out4['skew'] = ret_skew.values
out4['kurt'] = ret_kurt.values
print(out4.head())
```

              mean       std      skew       kurt
    MSFT  0.001883  0.012491 -0.194007   1.143430
    AAPL  0.002665  0.016466 -0.921614   7.240603
    GOOG  0.001129  0.015208  0.559534  11.537096
    AMZN  0.000926  0.014432 -0.058477   1.858702


The table above shows that Google and Apple have higher instances of abnormal returns. Generally, Stocks with high positive skewness and low kurtosis outperform the stocks that display negative skewness and high kurtosis 

### Autocorrelation
Autocorrelation measures the relationship between a variable's current value and its past values. An autocorrelation of +1 represents a perfect positive correlation, while an autocorrelation of negative 1 represents a perfect negative correlation. Autocorrelation is used to see how much of an impact past returns for a stock have on its future returns.


```python
#create empty list to put autocorrelation values
autocorr_res = []

from scipy.stats import pearsonr
# For-loop to calculate autocorrelation 
for i in ret.columns:
    data0 = ret[i]
    data = data0.dropna()
    corr, pval = pearsonr(data[:-1], data[1:])
    autocorr_res.append(corr)
    
#Add autocorrelation as a column
out4['autocorr'] = autocorr_res
print(out4.head())
```

              mean       std      skew       kurt  autocorr
    MSFT  0.001883  0.012491 -0.194007   1.143430 -0.125887
    AAPL  0.002665  0.016466 -0.921614   7.240603 -0.092361
    GOOG  0.001129  0.015208  0.559534  11.537096 -0.033810
    AMZN  0.000926  0.014432 -0.058477   1.858702 -0.004840


With low autocorrelations of -0.12 to 0, the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals is minimal thus past returns do not seem to influence future returns.

## Final Conclusion
The project begun with the endeavor to a retrieve financial stock prices from yahoo finance and basic data manipulation  to retrieve the stock returns. A basic analysis of financial stock returns by reviewing the key statistics is reviewed. Further work might involve stock portfolio return analysis under different investment strategies.
