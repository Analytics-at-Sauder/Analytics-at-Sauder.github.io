  <p><strong>Analytics@Sauder</strong> is a recent University of British Columbia (UBC) <a href="https://tlef.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF)</a> sponsored project. The objective of this Project is to curate a collection of open-source business analytics tools and resources, to promote opportunities for hands-on learning, to foster an online, academic community of business analytics, and to facilitate conversations around data analytics within a broader business context. We hope that the UBC Business Analytics Open Learning Resources can provide a platform of mutual learning: while we hope that this Project can be helpful to business analytics professionals of all skill levels, we appreciate all feedback on our resources so that we can continue to improve what we do. We welcome suggestions, contributions, and collaborations of all kinds.</p>
