  <p><strong>Analytics@Sauder</strong> is a recent University of British Columbia (UBC) Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF) sponsored project. The objective of this Project is to curate a collection of open-source business analytics tools and resources, to promote opportunities for hands-on learning, to foster an online, academic community of business analytics, and to facilitate conversations around data analytics within a broader business context. We hope that the UBC Business Analytics Open Learning Resources can provide a platform of mutual learning: while we hope that this Project can be helpful to business analytics professionals of all skill levels, we appreciate all feedback on our resources so that we can continue to improve what we do. We welcome suggestions, contributions, and collaborations of all kinds.</p>

  <h2>Navigate This Website</h2>
  <p>The <a href="blog.ubc.ca/businessanalytics" target="_blank"><strong>Blog</strong></a> page, UBC Business Analytics Blog, is a platform where users can share posts and have discussions around any news, tools, and applications involving data analytics in the business world. The <a href="projects.html" target="_blank"><strong>Projects</strong></a> page contains a list of Jupyter Notebooks with applications of analytics in various business domains. Detailed information on how to contribute to our repository can be found under the <a href="resources.html" target="_blank"><strong>Resources</strong></a> page, along with tutorials for Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Syzygy, and Binder.</p>

  <h2>For Educators</h2>
  <p>Another of the objective of <strong>Analytics@Sauder</strong> is to better connect business and analytics in an educational setting. As Business Analytics is a emerging academic field that is still in its development stage in most institutions, a fair number of students say that many business courses can further improve on the integration of analytics and vice versa. We hope that faculty members across universities can be inspired by this platform and design curriculumns that better incorporate <em>both</em> business and analytics</p>
  <p>Educators shall feel free to borrow from and contribute to this platform, by referring to the various Notebooks in and out of classrooms, providing feedback through our Blog and GitHub, and contacting us with any helpful resources especially data, scripts and Notebooks. By navigating to the <a href="notebooks.html" target="_blank"><strong>Notebooks</strong></a> page, you can find a collection of Business Analytics Notebooks organized by Topics and Skills respectively. We want to help our users think how analytics can be applied to the different business domains and, at the same time, how to generate business insights using analytics. On the other hand, we value any feedback or suggestions for these notebooks, and we encourage instructors to submit Issues and Pull Requests via GitHub, which you can learn more about on the <a href="resources.html#collaboration" target="_blank"><strong>Resources</strong></a> page.</p>
