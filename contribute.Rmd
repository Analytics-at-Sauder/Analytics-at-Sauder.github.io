### Suggestions for the Current Notebooks

If you discover more efficient algorithms or methods to solve the existing problems that we have in the notebooks, feel free to [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) within the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/Master-of-Business-Analytics).

### Resources

If you are not familiar with Git or GitHub, the [COE Tool Box](http://blogs.ubc.ca/coetoolbox/2017/04/21/getting-started-with-git-and-github/) provides a very detailed tutorial. We also encourage you to utilize [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) to familiarize yourself with the version control system; GitHub also provides [additional resources](https://try.github.io/) for you to learn Git itself.
